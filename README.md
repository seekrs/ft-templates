# ft-templates

This is a collection of free/libre templates for kickstarting your next 42 project.

**Note:** this is not a never-write-a-makefile-again solution, learn how make works, it's not that hard.

## Usage

<!-- These templates can be used via [ft-cli](https://github.com/seekrs/ft-cli), using the `ft init` command. -->

This repository also provides a standalone interactive script; just run the following command to get started:

```sh
bash <(curl -sSL init.seekrs.top)
```

Some experimental/highly-specific/broken templates aren't displayed by default, you can see them by running:

```sh
FTT_SHOW_ALL=1 bash <(curl -sSL init.seekrs.top)
```
